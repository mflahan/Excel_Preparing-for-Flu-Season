# Excel_Preparing-for-Flu-Season
Demonstration of Excel and Tableau for analysis of US CDC and Census data to develop staffing allocation recommendations
# Project Objective
Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
